;; Event handlers should actually just be transaction functions.
;; Most of the time.
;; But there are some operations for which this isn't quite right.
;; Maybe we just treat those separately and pass the rest through?
;; That might be the nicest way to handle things.
;; Since then, effects are just data that you accrue along with the unfolding transaction.

;; Just registering some handlers; Make sure to load this code!
