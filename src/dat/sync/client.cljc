;; * In DS You can transact a refid that isn't in any other datoms; will pull out, however not in Datomic

;; ## Distributed checksum
;; -----------------------

;; We'd like a simple method for ensuring we haven't missed any transactions, and that everything is
;; consistent.
;; I think we can do this with a simple hashing function that takes some key k (perhaps the client id)
