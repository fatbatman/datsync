;; Every time we get a transaction, we want to send the results of that transaction to every client.
;; Eventually we can get fancy with installing subscription middleware, so for each client we have a
;; specification of what they have "checked out", but this is just a starting point.

;; The easiest thing to do here is take the tx-data (datoms) produced by each transaction and convert those to
;; :db/add and :db/retract statements which we can send to clients.

;; For push architecture where we keep everything constantly up to date, we can subscribe to Datomic's tx
;; report queue, and fire off changes as we see fit.
